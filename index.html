          Hey, I have just started my journey with Programming Hero Community.
          In short, I've already completed five-module and a simple
          portfolio-making project with HTML and CSS. I hope I'll complete this
          journey as a sincere student of this course.

        <p>
          I am enrolled in the 5th batch of this programming hero course and as
          far as I know more than four and a half thousand people are doing this
          course. I like this, Because if many people are involved in the same
          work together, they become interested in seeing others.
